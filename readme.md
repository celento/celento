*Think twice before trusting someone who uses cat GIFs on Github*

**Most of my active repos are private** (due to obvious reasons) and would love to add meaningful contributions to OSS someday.

**Progress on this README.md thing**
- Updated the cat GIF multiple times
- Still haven't figured out anything to add here. In the meantime checkout my [website](https://celento.me) or ping me [@celento](https://www.twitter.com/celento) on Twitter
